# Fifa 2021 Pre Game Press Conference

>In the process of creating this Conference website, I set up a new repository and prepared it for development using best practices (e.g. linters). I then build the mobile version of the website using my own images and texts. After I then deployed the home and about pages on github pages.
Next I adapted the mobile version to the desktop version of the two pages and deployed on github.
The speaker section is created dynamically using javascript. The conference page is responsive and views well on different screen sizes.
